DESCRIPTION:
    In this assignment, I created a work day scheduler using pre-existing HTML and CSS. Bootstrap is utilized for styling, moment.js is utilized for catpuring time and dates, and JQuery is utilized for the script. 

    On this web page the user can plan their work day by adding tasks to each hour. These tasks will persist through refreshing the page or closing out and coming back to the page. As the day progress each hour block of the scheduler will change colors as the time becomes closer. Past hours are greyed out, current hour is red, and future hours are green.
